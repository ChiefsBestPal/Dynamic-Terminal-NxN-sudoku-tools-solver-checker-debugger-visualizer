## Solver Release 1 on challenging 3x3 
(Animation slower than computation because of pre determined speed)

## Solver Release 2 on challenging 3x3 
(Animation slower than computation, but the algorithm may need some work) **Graphics are stabile and great though.**

## example of visually-appealing extra tools in newer release
NOW: *Peculiar string encoding and terminal commands and pattern specific padding are a thing now for a stable and pretty visualization*
